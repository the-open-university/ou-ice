<p>They were very quick and abrupt in their actions, and their speech, in moments of hot discussion over the allotment of the choicer teeth, was truly a gabble. </p>
<p>They spoke in monosyllables and short jerky sentences that was more a gibberish than a language. </p>
<p>And yet, through it ran hints of grammatical construction, and appeared vestiges of the conjugation of some superior culture. Even the speech of Granser was so corrupt that were it put down literally it would be almost so much nonsense to the reader. This, however, was when he talked with the boys.</p>

<p>She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. </p>
<p>It was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself 'Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost wish I'd gone to see the Hatter instead!'</p>
<p>There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head.</p>

<h2 id="pull-mobile">Pull for mobile</h2>

<p>If using a small image or icon you may not want it to default to 100% width on mobile. Add the class <span class="ou-ice-code">ou-pull-X--mobile</span> where X is either left, centre or right. This will force the image to retain it's original size.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>

<p>At Andover, and later at Yale, I had pitched on winning ball teams. My speed and control must both have been above the ordinary, for I made such a record during my senior year at college that overtures were made to me in behalf of one of the great major-league teams; but in the tightest pitch that ever had confronted me in the past I had never been in such need for control as now. </p>
<p>As I wound up for the delivery, I held my nerves and muscles under absolute command, though the grinning jaws were hurtling toward me at terrific speed. And then I let go, with every ounce of my weight and muscle and science in back of that throw. The stone caught the hyaenodon full upon the end of the nose, and sent him bowling over upon his back.</p>

<p>At the same instant a chorus of shrieks and howls arose from the circle of spectators, so that for a moment I thought that the upsetting of their champion was the cause; but in this I soon saw that I was mistaken. </p>
<p>As I looked, the ape-things broke in all directions toward the surrounding hills, and then I distinguished the real cause of their perturbation. Behind them, streaming through the pass which leads into the valley, came a swarm of hairy menâ€”gorilla-like creatures armed with spears and hatchets, and bearing long, oval shields. </p>
<p>Like demons they set upon the ape-things, and before them the hyaenodon, which had now regained its senses and its feet, fled howling with fright. </p>
<p>Past us swept the pursued and the pursuers, nor did the hairy ones accord us more than a passing glance until the arena had been emptied of its former occupants.</p>

<h2 id="image-sizes">Image sizes</h2>

<p>OU ICE images should use the 8:5 image ratio (apart from heroes). This is the closest standard ratio to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_rectangle">golden rectangle</a> - the shape known in geometry with, theoretically, the most harmonious proportions.</p>
