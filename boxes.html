<h2 id="standard">Standard</h2>

<p>If you don't add any extra classes to the <span class="ou-ice-code">ou-box</span> you get a  grey box like so:</p>

<div class="code-example">
<div class="ou-box">
    <p>I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse before I could hope for a resurrection. Sixteen hours in bed! The small of my back ached to think of it.</p>
</div>
</div> <!-- end code-example -->

<hr>

<h2 id="bg">Background colours</h2>

<div class="code-example">
<h3>Light</h3>

<div class="ou-box ou-box--plain ou-bg-light-blue">
    <p>I have made this box light blue. The text remains black.</p>
</div>

<h3>Dark</h3>

<div class="ou-box ou-box--plain ou-bg-burgundy">
    <p>This one is burgundy coloured so the text changes to a more legible white.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="info">Info</h2>

<div class="code-example">
<div class="ou-box ou-box--info">
    <p>It was but too true that the railway came to a termination at this point. The papers were like some watches, which have a way of getting too fast, and had been premature in their announcement of the completion of the line.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2 id="note">Note</h2>

<div class="code-example">
<div class="ou-box ou-box--note">
    <p>Dorothy began to sob at this, for she felt lonely among all these strange people. Her tears seemed to grieve the kind-hearted Munchkins, for they immediately took out their handkerchiefs and began to weep also.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2 id="success">Success</h2>

<div class="code-example">
<div class="ou-box ou-box--success">
    <p>Hare-Lip, crushed by this metaphysical defeat, remained silent, and the old man went on. Often and often, though this narrative must not be clogged by the details, was Granser's tale interrupted while the boys squabbled among themselves.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2 id="warning">Warning</h2>

<div class="code-example">
<div class="ou-box ou-box--warning">
    <p>Are you sure you want to proceed?</p>
</div>
</div>


<hr>

<h2 id="combine">Combine with pull-left/right</h2>

<div class="code-example">
<div class="ou-box ou-box--note ou-pull-right">
    <p>Dorothy began to sob at this, for she felt lonely among all these strange people. Her tears seemed to grieve the kind-hearted Munchkins, for they immediately took out their handkerchiefs and began to weep also.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The old man's palsied eagerness was pitiful. Sitting down in the sand as quickly as his stiff limbs would let him, he poked a large rock-mussel from out of the coals. The heat had forced its shells apart, and the meat, salmon-colored, was thoroughly cooked. Between thumb and forefinger, in trembling haste, he caught the morsel and carried it to his mouth. But it was too hot, and the next moment was violently ejected. </p>
<p>The old man spluttered with the pain, and tears ran out of his eyes and down his cheeks. The boys were true savages, possessing only the cruel humor of the savage. To them the incident was excruciatingly funny, and they burst into loud laughter. Hoo-Hoo danced up and down, while Edwin rolled gleefully on the ground. The boy with the goats came running to join in the fun.</p>
