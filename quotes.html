<h1>Quotes</h1>

<p>Various options for styling quotations.</p>


<h2>Orange</h2>

<div class="code-example">
<blockquote class="ou-quote ou-bg-orange">
    <p>While it has been extremely challenging at times, having completed 3 tours of Afghanistan during my time studying, 
      along with the usual wife, family and general life to compete with my attention, it has also been one of the most rewarding 
      experiences of my life. Huge thanks to the OU.</p>

</div>


<h2>Dark blue</h2>

<div class="code-example">
<blockquote class="ou-quote ou-bg-dark-blue">
    <p>While it has been extremely challenging at times, having completed 3 tours of Afghanistan during my time studying, 
      along with the usual wife, family and general life to compete with my attention, it has also been one of the most rewarding

<h2>Purple</h2>

<div class="code-example">
<blockquote class="ou-quote ou-bg-dark-purple">
    <p>While it has been extremely challenging at times, having completed 3 tours of Afghanistan during my time studying, 
      along with the usual wife, family and general life to compete with my attention, it has also been one of the most rewarding

</div>


<p><strong>Note</strong>: if you don't want the "Read more" link you can simply omit that from the code.</p>

<h2>Lighter backgrounds</h2>

<p>For quotes with light background colours we need an extra class on the container so we can make the text darker in those scenarios.
The extra class is called "<strong>ou-quote--light</strong>".</p>

<div class="code-example">
<blockquote class="ou-quote ou-quote--light ou-bg-white">
    <p>While it has been extremely challenging at times, having completed 3 tours of Afghanistan during my time studying, 
      along with the usual wife, family and general life to compete with my attention, it has also been one of the most rewarding 
      experiences of my life. Huge thanks to the OU.</p>

<h2>All colour options</h2>

<p>Here is a list of the current background colours available for the quotes. You simply add this class to the blockquote container. For lighter backgrounds, two classes are required (see above).</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
/* Darker background, white text */
.ou-bg-green
.ou-bg-red
.ou-bg-dark-purple
.ou-bg-blue
.ou-bg-dark-blue
.ou-bg-dark-grey
.ou-bg-purple
.ou-bg-orange

/* Lighter background, black text. Requires extra ou-quote--light class */
.ou-bg-yellow
.ou-bg-light-blue
.ou-bg-grey
.ou-bg-light-grey
</pre>

<hr>

<h2>With pictures</h2>

<p>Add images to the quote using the standard class "ou-pull-right" to float the picture right. Recommended image size: 120px x 120px (square).</p>

<div class="code-example">
<blockquote class="ou-quote ou-bg-orange">
	<img src="demo/img/120x120/girl.jpg" alt="" class="ou-pull-right">
    <p>While it has been extremely challenging at times, having completed 3 tours of Afghanistan during my time studying, 
      along with the usual wife, family and general life to compete with my attention, it has also been one of the most rewarding

<h2>Pull quote - right</h2>
<div class="code-example">
  <blockquote class="ou-quote ou-pull-right ou-bg-red">
    <p>I love the OU... It has also been one of the most rewarding 
      experiences.</p>

<p>Champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics. But there is no Champollion to decipher the Egypt of every man's and every being's face. Physiognomy, like every other human science, is but a passing fable. </p>
<p>If then, Sir William Jones, who read in thirty languages, could not read the simplest peasant's face in its profounder and more subtle meanings, how may unlettered Ishmael hope to read the awful Chaldee of the Sperm Whale's brow? I but put that brow before you. Read it if you can. If the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx, to the phrenologist his brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to square. </p>

<h2>Pull quote - left</h2>
